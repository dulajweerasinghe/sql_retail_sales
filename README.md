# Retail Sales Analysis - SQL Project

## Overview
This project involves the design and analysis of a retail sales database using SQL. It showcases database design, data cleaning techniques, and querying skills for insights into retail sales data.

## Project Features
- **Database Setup**: A retail sales database (`sql_project_01`) was created to store and analyze transactional data.
- **Schema Design**: The `retail_sales` table contains fields for tracking transactions, customer information, product categories, and sales details.
- **Data Cleaning**: Queries identify and handle null or missing values to ensure data quality.
- **Analysis Queries**: Includes SQL queries for exploring sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

## Table Schema
The `retail_sales` table is structured as follows:
- **transactions_id**: Unique identifier for each transaction (Primary Key)
- **sale_date**: Date of the transaction
- **sale_time**: Time of the transaction
- **customer_id**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **gender**: Gender of the customer
- **age**: Age of the customer
- **category**: Product category
- **quantity**: Quantity of items purchased
- **price_per_unit**: Price per unit of the item
- **cogs**: Cost of goods sold
- **total_sale**: Total value of the transaction

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `sales_retail_db`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,	
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,	
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,	
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05**:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

2. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022**:
```sql
SELECT 
  *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    category = 'Clothing'
    AND 
    TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
    AND
    quantity >= 4
```

3. **Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(total_sale) as net_sale,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1
```

4. **Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.**:
```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(age), 2) as avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty'
```

5. **Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000
```

6. **Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    gender,
    COUNT(*) as total_trans
FROM retail_sales
GROUP 
    BY 
    category,
    gender
ORDER BY 1
```

7. **Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year**:
```sql
SELECT 
       year,
       month,
    avg_sale
FROM 
(    
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) as year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) as month,
    AVG(total_sale) as avg_sale,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) as rank
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1, 2
) as t1
WHERE rank = 1
```

8. **Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales **:
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_sale) as total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5
```

9. **Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    category,    
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as cnt_unique_cs
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category
```

10. **Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)**:
```sql
WITH hourly_sale
AS
(
SELECT *,
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END as shift
FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT 
    shift,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders    
FROM hourly_sale
GROUP BY shift
```

## Highlights
- **Data Validation**: Queries to identify missing values across multiple fields in the table.
- **One-Line Solutions**: Compact and efficient SQL queries for comprehensive data cleaning.
- **Insights Extraction**: Preparation for deeper analysis of sales data trends.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Load the `retail_sales.sql` file into your preferred SQL client or database system.
3. Execute the queries to create the database, clean data, and analyze sales trends.

## Future Work
- Adding indexes and optimizing the schema for faster querying.
- Building more advanced analytics queries (e.g., customer segmentation, product profitability analysis).
- Creating visualizations based on query outputs for better insights.
